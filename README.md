# Neural-Network-Final-Project

This final course project used the Breast Tumor Patients in Wisconsin dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data . The goal was to find the most effective variable in determining malignancy or benignity of a breast cancer tumor based on physical features from a biopsy. 

Models were run on all the variables, mean variables, worst variables and mean + se variables with  Logistic Regression and Neural Networks machine learning algorithms. Once we determined the best model, we created a variable importance plot to see which variable within the model would best indicate the outcome.
